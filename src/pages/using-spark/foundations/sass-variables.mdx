# Sass Variables

Sass variables provide global settings for components in the system. Almost every aspect of each Spark component is configurable with a Sass variable.

** Override these settings by: **
1. Creating a new Sass file.
2. Importing it before Spark's main Sass file.
3. Assigning a new value to the variable you want to override.

> These make global changes to your project. Changing a variable affects all instances of its relevant components. For one-off modifications, use [CSS utilities](/using-spark/foundations/css-utilities).
