# Alert

Alert is an unobtrusive, yet highly visible
way to display important information and
provide feedback to user action.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--success"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use to direct attention to notable information, or to give feedback after an action.

Example use cases:
- Show an alert after successful form submission.
- Direct to a part of the page that needs attention.
- Notify users of critical information.
- Inform a user with a dismissible Alert.

### Guidelines

- Place above the main content of the page, but below the Masthead.
- Use a clear and concise message that communicates one piece of information per Alert.
- The message can contain a call to action through a link. Do not use buttons.
- Alerts can be permanent or dismissed. If dismissable, choose how long it will stay on the page and if it's dismissable through the Close Icon.
- Do not use on top of sidebars or narrow elements.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>
